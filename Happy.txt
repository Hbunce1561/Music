Captain Chunk!
It's been a long time coming and I know it
Can't keep up with the world outside, can't control it
What's the plan? I'm not sure
Does anyone care anymore?
Laying out my thoughts trying to articulate them
That's a start
Got some built up frustration
'Cause there's only so much I can take
I might not bend before I break
I thought I couldn't live without you now
I need to restart again
Things won't go how you planned out
So just restart again
This is for the nights I felt like this
Wish I could forget it, never will regret it
Always had my doubts, I will admit
It's worth the risk so I don't end up bitter
Let's put it all into context
I guess you can say I made progress
I had no chance
Spent my time try to hold it together
I had to convince myself, it is time to get better
I get it, you don't wanna regret it
You can't admit that you said it
You said we were
You said we were better off dead
It all adds up to something
Can't pretend that it's nothing
So can we start over again?
I thought I couldn't live without you now
I need to restart again
Things won't go how you planned out
So just restart again
This is for the nights I felt like this
Wish I could forget it, never will regret it
Always had my doubts, I will admit
It's worth the risk so I don't end up (bitter)
